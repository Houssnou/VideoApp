# VideoApp
This a Video Chat App with ASP.NET Core, Angular, and Twilio

This video chat application using the Twilio JavaScript SDK in an Angular single page application (SPA) and the Twilio SDK for C# and .NET in ASP.NET Core server code. I built the interactions required to create and join video chat rooms, and to publish and subscribe to participant audio and video tracks.
